            <h2 id="eligibility-title">Maintaining Eligibility</h2>
            <p id="eligibility-text">To maintain your eligibility for financial aid, you must demonstrate academic progress towards a degree program. We utilize both qualitative and quantitative measures to determine Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). To view requirements for maintaining eligibility, visit the website <a href="https://www.stmartin.edu/admissions-financial-aid/undergraduate/financial-aid/maintaining-eligibility">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Please note that SAP is a process completed strictly to determine your financial aid eligibility and NOT your academic eligibility. For information on academic standing please contact <a href="mailto:Provost@stmartin.edu">Provost@stmartin.edu</a>.</p>

        <section id="appeal-process" class="content-card">
            <h2 id="appeal-process-title">Appeal Process</h2>
            <p id="appeal-text">Students on "must appeal" status have the opportunity to appeal their aid eligibility. Appeals must be submitted by mid-semester. Appeals submitted after the deadline will be reviewed but late petitions may result in the loss of funding for the semester. Appeals must include a written statement, academic plan, and documentation of extenuating circumstances.</p>

           <!-- <h4 id="approved-appeals-title">Approved Appeals</h4>
            <p id="approved-appeals-text">Students will be notified of an approved appeal and placed in probation status with their aid reinstated for one semester. Students may be asked to submit a new academic plan for each semester of probation status until they reach good standing. If the student does not pass the credits or earn the GPA given in an academic plan, they will be placed in must appeal status again.</p> -->

            <h4 id="denied-appeals-title">Denied Appeals</h4>
           <p id="denied-appeals-text">If an appeal is denied, aid will be removed from the following semester and the student must find other options to pay their student balance. For other financial resource counseling, please contact the Office of Financial Aid, <a href="mailto:FinAid@stmartin.edu">FinAid@stmartin.edu</a>.</p>
            <p id="denied-extra">If the original appeal did not include information that may have been helpful to know when evaluating the appeal, the student may submit additional information to provide clarity to be reviewed again.</p>
