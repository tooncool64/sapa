            <p id="sap-intro1">If you are a student seeking information on maintaining eligibility or need to submit an appeal, please log in using your Saint Martin's credentials.</p>
            <p id="sap-intro2">If you are an advisor here to approve a student’s appeal, or an administrator reviewing SAP appeals, log in with your Saint Martin's credentials as well.</p>

        <!-- Maintaining Eligibility -->
        <section id="maintaining-eligibility" class="content-card">
            <h2 id="eligibility-title">Maintaining Eligibility</h2>
            <p id="eligibility-text">In order to maintain your eligibility for financial aid, you must demonstrate academic progress towards a degree program. We utilize both qualitative and quantitative measures to determine Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). Please note that SAP is a process completed strictly to determine your financial aid eligibility and NOT your academic eligibility.</p>

        <!-- SAP Status -->
        <section id="sap-status" class="content-card">
            <h2 id="sap-status-title">SAP Status</h2>
            <h4 id="warning-title">Warning</h4>
            <p id="warning-text">Students who do not meet the GPA or pace of completion requirements for the first time will be placed in a warning status.</p>
            <h4 id="must-appeal-title">Must Appeal</h4>
            <p id="must-appeal-text">Students who do not meet the GPA or pace of completion requirements following a warning status semester are not eligible to receive federal, state, or institutional aid and are placed on a must appeal status. In addition, students for whom it is mathematically impossible to complete their degree within the maximum timeframe provided above will be placed on a must appeal status immediately.</p>
            <p id="must-appeal-extra">Some alternative loan and scholarship programs require students to be in good standing under SAP guidelines. You may submit a completed appeal to the Office of Financial Aid which documents extenuating circumstances that interfered with your academic performance.</p>

        <!-- Appeal Process -->
        <section id="appeal-process" class="content-card">
            <h2 id="appeal-process-title">Appeal Process</h2>
            <p id="appeal-text">Students on "must appeal" status have the opportunity to appeal their aid eligibility. Appeals must be submitted by mid-semester. Appeals submitted after the deadline will be reviewed but late petitions may result in the loss of funding for the term. Appeals must include a written statement, academic plan, and documentation of extenuating circumstances.</p>

            <h4 id="approved-appeals-title">Approved Appeals</h4>
            <p id="approved-appeals-text">Students will be notified of an approved appeal and placed in probation status with their aid reinstated for one semester. Students may be asked to submit a new academic plan for each semester of probation status until they reach good standing. If the student does not pass the credits or earn the GPA given in an academic plan, they will be placed in must appeal status again.</p>

            <h4 id="denied-appeals-title">Denied Appeals</h4>
            <p id="denied-appeals-text">If an appeal is denied, aid will be removed from the following semester, and the student is required to find other financial options to apply towards the student balance.</p>
            <p id="denied-extra">If the original appeal did not include information that may have been helpful for the Office of Financial Aid to know when evaluating the appeal, the student may submit additional information to provide clarity to be reviewed again.</p>
